# Calculator-Project
An Original Calculator page.

A simple calculator to work on my Bootstrap skills -- to re-create a calculator that I can use on my smartphone or in a browser window.

In addition to the Bootstrap flexibility, it's a good project for me in that it needs to handle a number of logic/math and string conversion problems to be useful.

This is all my own code.  Some of my projects here are built off of existing examples or lessons that I've elaborated upon enough to present as representative of my work, but this one was written completely by me except for some script lines calling in CDNs and the like.  Same for the CSS.
